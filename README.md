The files create a message board in django where boards and account are two apps that were used and the templates and statics were usefor the frontend work. The templates show all the htmls that views.py in each respective app integrated and the static showed the css and javascript that was used to format the templates There are also test.py files that were used for unit testing throughout the process. The message board still needs some functionality added but play arounf with it if you would like.
